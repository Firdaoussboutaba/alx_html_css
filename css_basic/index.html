    <h1>WELCOME TO MY FIRST PORTFOLIO</h1>
    <h2>I hope you like it</h2>
<h2>A passionate language Teacher and Voice-over Artist</h2>
<p>I'm a passionate language teacher professional with more than 7 years of experience in field of language teaching, e-commerce and voice-over. I'm particularly adept at voice editing and marketing. Recently, I successfully started my own e-commerce business in Africa and Gold countries.</p>

<h3>My Recent Project</h3>
<p>"In my recent project, I collaborated with a team to develop a new e-commerce platform for Sultana Self Care Company. The goal was to create a user-friendly and visually appealing platform to increase sales.</p>

<h3>My role as a Front-end developper</h3>
<p>I spearheaded the development of the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To ensure a seamless user experience, I implemented responsive design principles. A key challenge was integrating the payment gateway securely. I tackled this by researching and implementing best practices for data encryption.</p>

<h3>The Great Results</h3>
<p>The new platform resulted in a rocket increase in sales within the first month. Users praised the platform's intuitive interface and ease of navigation. This project solidified my skills in digital marketing, sales, funnels and design.</p>
